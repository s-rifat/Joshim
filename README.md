# Joshim
This is our first group project in university life. We built the game when we were in first year second semester. 
This is a simple dual fighting game. There are three rounds. You have to win at least two rounds to win. Joshim is the main character of
the game. 

#Things we used
The game was built using igraphics. The language we used here is C. The IDE we used here is Visual Studio 2010.

#How can you run this in your pc?
Simply download this and open it in Visual studio. If you have a different version, you may need to open a project and copy all the files 
inside your project. The name of the project should be same.
